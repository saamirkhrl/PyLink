A URL shortener built using Flask and flask-sqlalchemy. Simply, you just input your original URL, then it gets added to the database and a new shorter url is generated. Those two URLs get mapped, so when you go to localhost:5000/<short_url>, you get redirected to the orignal url.

Added a new feature where in the WEBHOOK_URL you can add your own Discord webhook url and you get notified when a new link is created, which then helps you analyze your user's internet traffic.
